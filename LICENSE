# Ethical Guidelines for Healthcare Red Teaming

## Core Principles
1. **Patient Safety First**: Never compromise real medical devices or patient care systems
2. **Data Protection**: Never interact with real patient data (PHI/PII)
3. **Authorization**: Obtain written permission before any testing
4. **Compliance**: Adhere to HIPAA, GDPR, and local regulations
5. **Disclosure**: Report all findings through proper channels

## Prohibited Actions
❌ Testing on live medical devices  
❌ Accessing real patient records  
❌ Disrupting clinical operations  
❌ Sharing simulated patient data outside secure environments  

## Recommended Workflow
1. Obtain written authorization
2. Conduct testing in isolated lab environments
3. Use only simulated data
4. Document all findings
5. Securely destroy test artifacts
6. Report vulnerabilities responsibly

## Regulatory Considerations
- HIPAA Security Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and C of Part 164)
- HITECH Act requirements
- FDA Premarket Cybersecurity Guidance
- NIST SP 800-66 Rev. 2 (HIPAA Security Rule Implementation)
